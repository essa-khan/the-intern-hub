# The Intern Hub

The Intern Hub - Received the Most Creative Hack Award

Tech Stack: JavaScript, Node.js, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

I led a team of 11 in a State Farm-wide hackathon with 78 teams and ~670 participants across all hubs. In light of State Farm’s decision to continue their Summer Internship program remotely, our team created a one-stop-shop for every intern’s basic needs. We developed The Intern Hub, a web app to guide interns during the onboarding process and well beyond their beginning weeks.

This repository does not contain code due to its sensitive internal information (placeholders in demo). Check out the demo below!
